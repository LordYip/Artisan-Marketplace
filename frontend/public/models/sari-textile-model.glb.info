# Sari Textile AR Model

This is a placeholder for a sari/textile 3D model that would be generated based on uploaded textile images.

## Expected Features:
- Draped fabric simulation
- Textile pattern mapping
- Color and design preservation
- Realistic fabric physics in AR

## Model Properties:
- Format: GLB/GLTF
- Optimized for mobile AR
- Texture resolution: 1024x1024
- Polycount: ~5000-10000 for performance

The actual model file would be generated by:
1. Analyzing the uploaded sari image
2. Extracting pattern and color information
3. Creating a 3D drape simulation
4. Mapping the original design onto the 3D model
5. Optimizing for AR viewing
